      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Thank you for using <strong>SereniTea Pro</strong> (the “App”). This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have. By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Policy.</p>

      <p>The App may include third-party SDKs or services for features such as crash analytics, performance monitoring, or authentication. These parties collect and process data in accordance with their own privacy policies. We strive to integrate only reputable providers and to configure them to minimize personal data collection where feasible.</p>
      <p class="note">You can review or change permissions in your device settings. Some features may not work without certain permissions.</p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>We use commercially reasonable safeguards designed to protect your information (e.g., encryption in transit, access controls). However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
    </section>

    <section>

    <section>
      <h2>California Privacy Notice (CPRA)</h2>
      <p>If you are a California resident, you have the right to know categories of personal information collected, sources, purposes of use, and disclosures; the right to delete, correct, and receive a portable copy of certain information; and the right to opt out of “sharing” for cross-context behavioral advertising. We do not sell personal information as defined under California law.</p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Do Not Track</h2>
      <p>Some browsers offer a “Do Not Track” (DNT) signal. Because there is no uniform standard for DNT, the App does not currently respond to DNT signals.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated “Last updated” date at the top of this page. Material changes will be effective when posted unless otherwise stated.</p>
